# The Bias Files

An interactive visual novel exploring AI bias through a comic book-style interface.

## Overview

**The Bias Files** is an educational web-based visual novel that teaches users about the four major types of bias in AI systems through engaging storytelling and visual design. Built with pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, it presents complex concepts in an accessible, comic book format.

## Features

- **Interactive Comic Book Interface**: Navigate through 10 pages using buttons, keyboard arrows, or touch gestures
- **Four Types of AI Bias Covered**:
  1. **Historical Bias**: How AI learns from biased past data (Amazon hiring AI case study)
  2. **Representation Bias**: Under-representation in training data (facial recognition disparities)
  3. **Aggregation Bias**: How averages hide minority group struggles
  4. **Evaluation Bias**: Problems with biased benchmarks and testing
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Pure CSS Illustrations**: All visual elements created using CSS art
- **Real-World Case Studies**: Based on actual incidents including Amazon's AI hiring tool (2014-2017) and Joy Buolamwini's Gender Shades Study (2018)

## Educational Content

This project is based on the included PDF "Big Data, Big Responsibilities" and covers real-world examples of AI bias:

- **Amazon's AI Hiring Tool**: Discriminated against female candidates by learning from historical hiring patterns
- **Facial Recognition Disparities**: MIT Media Lab study showing accuracy rates as low as 65.3% for Black women vs 99.2% for white males
- **Resource Allocation**: How aggregated data can hide the needs of smaller communities
- **Biased Benchmarks**: Testing datasets that don't represent real-world diversity

## Technical Details
